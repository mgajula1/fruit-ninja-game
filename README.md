# fruit-ninja-game
Created a Fruit Ninja game on MBed microcontroller with LED display. Game allows player to shoot fruit and bombs with additional power-ups! 
Use the pushbuttons or accelerometer to move the player up and down the left-hand side of the screen. Use the pushbuttons to shoot knives at the fruit but watch out for bombs.
If you're lucky, you may be able to hit a powerup, which allows for extra lives, resetting the compost pile of missed fruit, or another special surprise. 

This game was coded by Madhurya Gajula for her ECE 2035 final project at Georgia Tech.
